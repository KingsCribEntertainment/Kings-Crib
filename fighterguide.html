            their moves, combos, and
            strengths and weaknesses.</h3>

        <h3 class="grid-one">Learn the fundamentals: Before diving into advanced techniques, it's important to learn the
            basics of the game such as blocking, movement, and attacking. Spend time in practice mode learning how to

        <h3 class="grid-one">Master your character's moves: Once you've learned the basics, focus on mastering your
            character's moves. Spend time in practice mode executing their special moves, combos, and unique attacks.
            Try to understand the purpose of each move and how it can be used in different situations.</h3>
        <h3 class="grid-one">Understand frame data: Frame data is the amount of time it takes for a move to start up,
            how long it lasts, and how much recovery time there is after it. Understanding frame data is essential to
            optimizing your combos and knowing when to punish your opponent's moves.</h3>

            time in practice mode perfecting your combos, movement, and defense. It's also a good idea to play against
            other players online or in local tournaments to gain experience and test your skills.</h3>
        <h3 class="grid-one">Watch and learn: Watch high-level players of your character and take note of their
            playstyle, combos, and strategies. You can also watch replays of your own matches to identify areas of
            weakness and areas to improve on.</h3>
